## Hi, I'm Angie 👩🏻‍💻

The _best_ innovations combine creativity, empathy, and data, helping people connect, learn, and navigate the world more meaningfully.

##For me? It's Tech for Good 💡
I love working on **tech-for-good** projects that tell a story and solve real-world problems. Hackathons are my favorite space for that: fast-paced, collaborative, and full of purpose. Some of my favorite projects include:
	•	**AeroGuard – NASA Space Apps Challenge “Global Impact” Winner** 🌍
An AI-powered emergency response platform that uses NASA TEMPO satellite data to support communities during wildfire and air quality events.
	•	**My AI Advisor – CUHackit “Best Use of AWS” Winner** ☁️
A personal AI assistant that integrates multiple APIs to deliver data-driven insights and guidance. You can check out the project on my **[Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/my-ai-advisor)**.
	•	**CollageGenerator**🎵
A fun project that uses the Spotify API to create personalized music collages based on your listening habits — because tech should also bring a little joy.
