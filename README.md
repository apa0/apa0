## Hi, I'm Angie 👩🏻‍💻

I’m an aspiring Software Engineer and AI Enthusiast with a passion for building creative, data-driven solutions. Many of my projects (including my undergraduate research) are private, but I’m always eager to collaborate and learn. I thrive in environments where I can contribute to innovative tech, and I’m always excited to solve problems using Python, Java, and C++.

I love participating in hackathons, where I can push my skills, work with new technologies, and build something impactful in a short amount of time. 🚀 One of my proudest moments was working on my CUHackit project, where we won Best Use of AWS! You can check out the project on my [Devpost](ttps://devpost.com/software/my-ai-advisor).  

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with AWS or diving into data visualization to make complex information more accessible and actionable.

CollageGenerator – A project that uses the Spotify API to create personalized collages based on your music taste!
